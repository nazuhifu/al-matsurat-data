# Al-Ma'tsurat JSON Collection (Sughra & Kubra)

This is a simple and structured JSON version of **Al-Ma’tsurat** (sometimes written *Al-Matsurat*) — a well-known compilation of daily Islamic remembrances (_dzikr pagi petang_) arranged by **Imam Hasan Al-Banna**.

I created this repo so it can be reused by anyone who wants to build Islamic apps, educational tools, or simply needs a clean digital version to work with.

## 🌅 What’s Inside?

The collection includes two versions:
- **Sughra** (shorter version)
- **Kubra** (full/long version)

Each entry in the JSON contains:
- `id`: the order number
- `title`: the name or reference of the dhikr/verse
- `arabic`: the original Arabic text
- `latin`: transliteration to Latin alphabet
- `translation_id`: Indonesian translation
- `repeat`: how many times it is usually recited

All data is grouped under `sections` by version and time of day (e.g., *morning* and *evening*).

## 📁 Files

You’ll find both files in the `data/` folder:

- `sughra.json`
- `kubra.json`
